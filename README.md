# Customer_churn_analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company using various machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict whether a customer will churn based on their behavior and demographic factors. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains the following relevant files:

- **`tel_churn.csv`**: The main dataset containing customer information and churn status.
- **`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`**: An alternative dataset for comparison and validation of results.
- **`model.sav`**: The trained Random Forest model saved for future use or predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for analysis and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment used to run the analysis.
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - Imbalanced-learn

## Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lijoks/customer_churn_project.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
      cd customer_churn_project
   
3. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have requirements.txt, you'll need to manually install the libraries mentioned in the Technologies Used section.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
      jupyter notebook notebooks/customer_churn.ipynb
   
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the analysis and generate predictions.

## Results

The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of using Random Forest models to predict customer churn with high accuracy. Key findings include the identification of important features influencing customer churn decisions.

## Conclusion

This project provides a structured approach to analyzing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. It showcases the use of machine learning to derive insights and make predictions relevant for business strategies.
